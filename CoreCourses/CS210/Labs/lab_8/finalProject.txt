Final Project

    The project of writing a C program that will take input of arithmetic expressions, 
and print out a correct MIPS program to carry out the computations and print the results.

    This project seems interesting to me for a number of reasons.  It would give me more experience 
with processing strings in C, then using this information to write loops that will produce the
correct output.  I think it would be interesting to create a program that did this and write a master 
program that will first run the C program to translate the arithmetic expression into MIPS, then have 
the program tell you when that has completed, and automatically run the MIPS Program.  An additional nice 
feature would be to add in a check program in C to ensure the C program made the correct translation, and that 
translation was carried out properly.  I would like to solidify my understanding of the C language
and this would be an excellent way to accomplish that.  

    The second option would also be a good final project, but would be my second choice.
