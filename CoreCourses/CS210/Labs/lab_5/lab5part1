# Lab 5 Part 1: modify example program to swap values so the first integer is less than or equal to the second

# Section 1 of program: read in the two integers and save them in registers s0, s1:
	la	$a0,prompt	# ask user to enter values
	li	$v0,4		# print_string
	syscall
	li	$v0,5		# read_int
	syscall
	add	$s0,$zero,$v0	# First integer a in s0
	li	$v0,5		# read_int
	syscall
	add	$s1,$zero,$v0	# Second integer b in s1

# Section 2 of program: examine if first integer is larger than second integer, if so switch the integers for more efficient performance
	li	$s3, 1
	#first see if a is less than b, if it is go to the else1 statement	
	slt	$s2, $s1, $s0	#sets $s2 equal to 1 if b is less than a, we now need to switch the values so a < b
	beq	$s2, $s3, else1	#if a is less than b then go to else1 loop
	j	begin
else1:	add	$s2, $s0, $zero	#moves a to temporary
	add	$s0, $s1, $zero	#moves b to a
	add	$s1, $s2, $zero	#moves temp a to b
	

	# a must be the smaller number
			
# Section 2 of program: use s0 to count down to 0 while adding b to sum:
begin:	li	$s2,0	# Sum in s2
loop:	beq	$zero,$s0,done	# If a == 0, done
	add	$s2,$s2,$s1	# sum = sum + b
	addi	$s0,$s0,-1	# a = a-1
	j	loop
done:	add	$a0,$zero,$s2	# Copy sum into a0 for printing
	li	$v0,1		# print_int
	syscall
	
# Section 3: terminate program normally:
	li	$v0,10
	syscall
